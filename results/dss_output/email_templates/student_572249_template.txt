Subject: Check-in: How are you doing in [Course Name]?

Dear Student 572249,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because I've noticed some patterns in your early engagement with the course that I'd like to discuss.

I'm particularly concerned because:
- Your activity level in the first two weeks has been quite low
- This early engagement is often a strong indicator of course success

I'd like to schedule a brief 15-minute call to:
1. Understand if you're facing any challenges
2. Discuss strategies to help you succeed
3. Connect you with support resources if needed

Please feel free to respond to this email or book a time slot here: [Booking Link]

I'm here to support your success!

Best regards,
